# DistributedSystemConcurrency
Following is a Process concurrency model implemented taking in reference to RicartAgarWala Algorithm, also taking inta account of the priority of the process.. 

1. Run the all_execute bash file. This will run the server.
2. Now, Run each of the Node files i.e Node 1/2/3/4/5. This file will act as the client as well as the server.
3. Following will follow the same workflow as that of RicartAgarwala. But, it also the take into consideration the priority of client process.
